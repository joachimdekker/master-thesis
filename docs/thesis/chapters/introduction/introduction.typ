Microsoft Excel is arguably the most widely used programming environment worldwide @gordon_lambda_2021. The interface can be seen as the IDE, and the worksheet and the formulas as the code. At pension fund companies, it is used to maintain and calculate the pension fund interest for all of its customers. 

Pension fund employees use Excel worksheets as their tool to compute the forecasts under a range of different situations. There are more than a thousand situations per person. For example, a user might want to know what their pension will look like if they take their pension when 65 years old, when the economy has been good. All of these situations need to be calculated for nearly 1 million customers every year.

One of the partners of the pension funds, Info Support B.V., converted the tool to a high-level programming language, but this was done manually. Since the pension fund employees are not able to program and extend the code, when another scenario should be added, only the excel file is updated and needs to be manually converted by info support. Hence, Info Support---as part of the ongoing _GROENpensioen_ project---aims to automatically convert these calculations from Microsoft Excel to high performing code to improve reliability, performance and durability. While there have been work on extracting models from spreadsheets, there is no tool to convert the calculations in a spreadsheet to higher-level code.

The converting process entails multiple steps, from compiling excel formulas to a generic programming language to applying optimalizations to the dataflow. In this thesis, we will explore the former problem of compiling excel files to coherent, high-performing higher level programming language code in the context of actuarial computations. This approach will therefore focus on the computational model of the excel engine.
