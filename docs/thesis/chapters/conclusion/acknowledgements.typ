#heading([Acknowledgements], bookmarked: false, )

First, I would like to thank Info Support for their continuous support, even when things outside of my control confronted me _head on_. Their understanding and patience during this time was truly appreciated. Especially my process supervisor Nikki Thissen. Without their encouragement and help this thesis would not have been written this easily.

Naturally, I thank my supervisors. [Write something to Bjorn and Andr√©s]

I would like to thank Ruben Franquinet for his contribution to the name of _Excelerate_, without him the name probably would have been a lot less cool.

Finally, I thank Geert Haans, Jens Steenmetz, Thijs Boerefijn, and Ruben Franquinet for helping with proofreading the thesis and being the rubber duckies in my writing process. Their suggestions aided in a significant improvement in clarity.
