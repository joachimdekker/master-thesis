First, I would like to thank Info Support for their continuous support, even when things outside of my control confronted me _head on_. Their understanding and patience during this time was truly appreciated. Especially my process supervisor Nikki Thissen. Without their encouragement and help this thesis would not have been written this easily.

More importantly, I thank my supervisors Bjorn Jacobs and Andr√©s Goens for their support during this thesis. Their questions and constructive feedback helped me sharpen both the technical and academic quality of this thesis.

I would like to thank Ruben Franquinet for his contribution to the name of _Excelerate_, without him the name probably would have been a lot less cool.

Finally, I thank Geert Haans, Jens Steenmetz, Thijs Boerefijn, and Ruben Franquinet for helping with proofreading the thesis and being the rubber duckies in my writing process. Their suggestions aided in a significant improvement in clarity.
