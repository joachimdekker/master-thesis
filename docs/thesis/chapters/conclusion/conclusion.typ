= Conclusion

- In this thesis, we set out to investigate the possibility of compiling Excel to clear, human-readable C\# code. 

- RQ1: Multi-phase compiler, three steps with Structural, Compute and Code Layout, identifying structures with structural-compilation: letting the structures guide the compilation.
- RQ2: we identified tables and chains, and exploited these patterns for a significant improvement in readability.
- RQ3: we demonstrated that the generated Csharp code consistently outperforms Excel across all benchmark workbooks.
- RQ4: we introduced a method that generates 'unit tests' for the compiler by parametrising all available input and generating random input to test conformance to Excel's calculation engine.

- Structure-aware compilation can bridge the gap between Excel and readable code.
