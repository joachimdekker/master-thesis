== Budget example
Actual actuarial spreadsheets can be enormous. To ground the ideas, we introduce the _family budget_ example spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is used for keeping track of the family budget and is provided by Microsoft as an introduction to the features of Excel. This makes it an Excellent example and benchmark for the features of the compiler.

While actually compiling this spreadsheet might be overkill, it provides a good way to think about the computations and help visualize the ideas presented in this thesis. We will introduce the various components of the budget example along the way.
